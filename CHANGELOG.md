# Changelog

All notable changes to pyaegean are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

The accumulating set for the first release (alpha). **Not yet published to PyPI** —
the first PyPI release is planned for a later (1.0) milestone; until then, install
from source: `pip install git+https://github.com/ryanpavlicek/pyaegean`. A
specialist Python toolkit for Ancient Greek and the Aegean syllabic scripts;
analysis of the undeciphered Linear A material is always labeled exploratory, never
presented as ground truth.

### Added
- **Core** (`aegean.core`): a script-agnostic model — `Corpus`, `Document`, `Token`,
  `Sign`, `SignInventory`, `Numeral`, a `Script` plugin registry, and `Provenance`
  that travels with every corpus and stamps exports.
- **Linear A** (`aegean.scripts.lineara`): bundled 1,721-inscription corpus, 84-sign
  inventory, sign→sound map, and transliteration.
- **Analysis** (`aegean.analysis`): accounting reconciliation (KU-RO / PO-TO-KU-RO),
  wildcard sign-pattern search, weighted phonetic distance + alignment, morphology
  clustering, collocation statistics, a compound query engine, and tablet-structure
  classification — all parity-tested against golden fixtures.
- **Greek NLP** (`aegean.greek`): Unicode/Beta Code normalization, tokenization,
  syllabification, accent and prosody analysis, dactylic-meter scansion (hexameter +
  elegiac pentameter), reconstructed IPA (Attic/Koine), POS tagging, a rule-based
  morphological analyzer, and a baseline lemmatizer. An **opt-in** treebank backend
  (`greek.use_treebank()`, Perseus AGDT v2.1) supplies attested, correctly-accented
  lemmas and gold POS for known forms. A benchmark harness scores the pipeline and
  measures the treebank lift.
- **AI layer** (`aegean.ai`, `aegean.translate`): a provider-agnostic LLM client
  (Anthropic, OpenAI, xAI Grok, Gemini — SDKs optional), response caching, corpus
  grounding with prompt-injection wrapping, and hybrid lexicon+LLM translation. Every
  generative result is a provenanced, exploratory-labeled `ExploratoryResult`.
- **Data** (`aegean.data`): bundled JSON corpora plus a `fetch()` download-to-cache
  layer (sha256-verified, atomic, idempotent) for large assets — e.g. the Linear A
  facsimile imagery and the AGDT treebank — which are never bundled or re-hosted.

### Notes
- Requires Python ≥ 3.10. The wheel stays under 3 MB (CI-guarded); `numpy`/`pandas`/
  `scipy` and provider SDKs are imported lazily.
- Licensing: code Apache-2.0; Linear A corpus JSON via GORILA/mwenge; Linear A imagery
  © École Française d'Athènes and others (fetched, not redistributed); the Perseus
  AGDT treebank is CC BY-SA 3.0 (fetched + built in the cache, not bundled). See
  `NOTICE`.

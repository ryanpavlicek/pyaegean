# pyaegean

**A specialist Python toolkit for Ancient Greek**: alphabetic Greek *and* the
Aegean syllabic scripts (Linear A, Linear B, Cypriot, and Cypro-Minoan). pyaegean focuses narrowly and
deeply on Greek and the Aegean world: a script-agnostic corpus data layer, the
analytical methods from the Linear A Research Workbench, translation, and a
pluggable multi-provider AI layer.

> **Status: v0.30.0 (beta).** The API is close to stable but may still shift before 1.0.
> The script-agnostic core, Linear A, **Linear B** (Mycenaean Greek),
> the **Cypriot syllabary** (Arcado-Cypriot Greek), and the undeciphered **Cypro-Minoan** script
> complete the Aegean set: each deciphered script with a sign inventory, transliteration, and a
> Greek-reading bridge; Cypro-Minoan, undeciphered, ships its sign inventory only. The Greek
> NLP track is a full pipeline: a zero-dependency core (tokenize → scansion → IPA → POS →
> morphology → lemmas), opt-in backends (Perseus AGDT treebank, LSJ glossing, generalizing
> taggers/lemmatizers), and an opt-in **neural pipeline** (`use_neural_pipeline`): one
> jointly-trained torch-free model for tagging, morphology, **UD dependency parsing**, and
> lemmatization that is **state of the art on the UD Ancient Greek (Perseus) benchmark**
> ([measured](Greek-NLP#the-neural-pipeline-opt-in): 97.0 UPOS / 96.0 UFeats / 94.3 lemma /
> 90.2 UAS / 85.6 LAS on the Perseus test fold, end-to-end from raw text). The track also
> includes real works on demand (`load_work("tlg0012.tlg001")` → the Iliad), a benchmark
> harness, and a neutral out-of-AGDT (PROIEL) evaluator. The multi-provider AI layer + hybrid translation are
> implemented, over a corpus data layer with a lossless JSON round-trip (`to_json`/`from_json`)
> and a compound `query()`, plus EpiDoc/CSV/Parquet export. Analytical and generative output on the
> undeciphered Linear A material is **exploratory**: see [Limitations](Limitations) for the full
> picture of what pyaegean can and cannot claim, and [Data & Provenance](Data-and-Provenance) for
> where every dataset comes from.

### New here?

- **Never used Python?** Start with **[Getting Started](Getting-Started)**: it
  walks you from "I have nothing installed" to your first result, no prior
  programming assumed.
- **Prefer the terminal?** `pip install "pyaegean[cli]"`, then **`aegean
  quickstart`** runs the guided first five minutes: seven real commands, live on
  the bundled data, all offline. Want an app-like cockpit? `pip install
  "pyaegean[tui]"` adds **`aegean tui`**, a full-screen terminal UI to browse a
  corpus, run the live Greek workbench, and manage the data store. See [CLI](CLI).
- **Want to learn by doing?** The **[Tutorial](Tutorial)** answers two real
  research questions end to end: one in Linear A, one in Greek.
- **Something not working?** See the **[FAQ & Troubleshooting](FAQ)**.

## Quick start

```python
import aegean

corpus = aegean.load("lineara")          # 1,721 inscriptions, bundled, offline
print(len(corpus))                       # 1721

ht = corpus.filter(site="Haghia Triada") # filter by metadata (site name)
df = corpus.to_dataframe(level="word")   # pandas-native, one row per word

from aegean.analysis import balance_check, word_matches_sign_pattern
checks = balance_check(corpus.get("HT13"))          # KU-RO accounting reconciliation
hits = [w for w, _ in corpus.word_frequencies()
        if word_matches_sign_pattern(w, "KU-*-RO")] # wildcard sign search
```

```python
from aegean import greek
greek.betacode_to_unicode("mh=nin")          # 'μῆνιν'
greek.syllabify("ἄνθρωπος")                  # ['ἄν', 'θρω', 'πος']
greek.accentuation("λόγος").classification    # 'paroxytone'
```

## Install

```bash
pip install pyaegean            # core + Linear A + Greek
pip install "pyaegean[cli]"     # + the `aegean` command line
pip install "pyaegean[ai]"      # + Anthropic / OpenAI / Grok / Gemini / OpenRouter clients
pip install "pyaegean[all]"     # everything
```

See [Installation](Installation) for the full extras matrix, and
[Development](Development) to build from source and run the test suite.

## Roadmap

**Current release: v0.30.0.** pyaegean covers all four Aegean scripts, fourteen loadable corpora
(through the 57,000-papyrus DDbDP documentary corpus), and a deep, zero-dependency
Greek NLP track (opt-in treebank, lexicon, and neural backends, including the state-of-the-art
neural joint pipeline), a structured corpus and provenance data layer, the `aegean` CLI, the
`aegean-mcp` server, and a grounded multi-provider AI layer. The pages in the sidebar cover every
feature in depth; the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ryanpavlicek/pyaegean/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
has the per-release history.

**On the list next:**

- More public-domain dictionaries in the registry (Autenrieth, Slater), as their open digitizations are confirmed license-clean
- SigLA apparatus decoding; richer `load_work` addressing across more of the Perseus / First1KGreek canon
- Wider gazetteer / Pleiades coverage
